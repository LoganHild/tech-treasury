  ## Description
  This is a tech-blog for developers to share the latest and greatest information about new technologies. Users can add comments as well as being able to edit and delete their own posts.

  ## Installation
  * If installing on local from github ==>
  
  First clone the repo and use <code>npmi</code> to install the necessary dependencies. Afterwards, use <code>npm run seed</code> in the terminal to seed the database. Once that is complete the app will be ready to use.

  ## Usage
  When first entering the app, the user will see posts from other users. The user can click the login/signup navigation link to be brought to the login page. There is a link in the login page that the user can click if they are new and do not have an account. Once the user is in their account, they can add comments to any post which will display their username as well as the time they made the comment. If the user uses the navigation link for dashboard, they will be brought to their personal dashboard, displaying all their posts. If the user is new there will be nothing but a "new post" button. The user can click this to create a new post about whatever they would like. This new post form will allow the user to add a title as well as content, then will be displayed on both their dashboard as well as the homepage with their username and the date/time created. If the user would like to edit their post or even delete it they can do so from their dashboard. Click the post to be edited/deleted and it will display the title and content in an editable format. Once the changes are made, click the update button to update the post with the new changes. There will also be a delete button for removing the post entirely.
